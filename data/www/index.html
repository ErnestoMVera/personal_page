				I'm currently finishing my master's degree in Science from Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC), the title of my thesis is <i> Prediction model analysis for Fitness to drive based on visual behaviors</i>; where I used a smart sensing system which consists of an inertial sensor and a smartphone camera, with on-road measurements from the system I analyzed various regression models to predict an on-road driving score.<br><br>In 2022 I graduated with honors from the B.S of Computer Engineer of UABC, where I acquired my taste for computer hardware and electronics as well as learning the fundamentals of computer programming and what makes good software.

				I did an intership at the Human Motion Analylisis Lab at Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion (INR) via a collaboration project between INR and UABC in 2022.<br>I redesigned a biofeedback system for gait rehabilitation using inertial sensors, which involved redesigning the app architecture, resulting in a performance, maintainability and scalability improvement of the system, as well as the addition of new features such as the flexibility to use any bluetooth inertial sensor with the app.
